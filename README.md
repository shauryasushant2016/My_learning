**Loan Default Prediction Project**

_Problem Statement:_

**Title:** 
Loan Default Prediction and Evaluation Criteria

**Background:**
Predicting loan defaults is critical for financial institutions to manage risk, maintain profitability, and ensure sustainable growth. Traditional risk assessment methods, relying on credit scores and basic financial information, often fall short in capturing complex patterns and relationships in the data. A more advanced approach is needed for efficient prediction.

**Problem:**
The task is to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using a machine learning model.
The model should consider various factors influencing repayment, such as income, employment status, credit score, loan details, and interest rate.
Addressing data imbalances, missing values, and outliers is crucial for effective model performance.

**Approach:**
Demonstrate a deep understanding of the problem, proposing a solution that involves building a predictive model.
Showcase proficiency in machine learning algorithms, data analysis, pre-processing, feature engineering, and model evaluation methods.

**Deliverables:**
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook highlighting the entire data science pipeline.
A detailed presentation explaining the problem, solution approach, and insights derived from the analysis.
Optionally, provide a system architecture design for a more holistic understanding.

**Expected Outcomes:**
Accurate loan default predictions.
Robust handling of data challenges, including imbalances, missing values, and outliers.
A well-documented and explained data science process.
